    Exercise 2.2: An alternative implementation for the eight-queen problem 
    would be to generate all possible permutations of 1 to 8 and, for each 
    permutation, to check whether it is valid. Change the program to use this
    approach. How does the performance of the new program compare with the old 
    one? 
    (Hint: compare the total number of permutations with the number of times 
     that the original program calls the function isplaceok.)


     I'm not going to bother with this non-sense. Sorry if you've come looking
     for a solution.

     This would be 8^8 (16,777,216) permutations to generate.
