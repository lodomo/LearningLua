# Learning Lua

I will be read Programming in Lua, Fourth Edition by Roberto Ierusalimschy.

As I progress through the book I'll make notes and write code snippets for each chapter. If I make a project that isn't directly 
from the book, if small, will be in the "projects" folder, and if large will be linked to a different repository in this readme.

Welcome to my journey of learning Lua!
